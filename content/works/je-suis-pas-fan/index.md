A fan blows across the Post-it notes stuck to it, each in a different color and bearing one of two French sentences—“Je suis fan.” (I’m a fan / I like it) or “Je suis pas fan.” (I’m not a fan / I don’t like it). When a note is blown away, its corresponding phrase sounds softly in Chinese as “I like it” or “I don’t like it.”

The word “fan” in English carries two senses: an electric fan and a supporter (or admirer)—and the random falling of the notes borrows from the French folk game effeuiller la marguerite (“she loves me / she loves me not”), in which one plucks daisy petals one by one to divine a beloved’s feelings.

Through this multilayered language game, the fan transforms into a flower, reversing others’ feelings toward it (does she love me or not) into its own preference (do I like it or not), while simultaneously embarking on its own existential inquiry (Am I / am I not a fan?). Thus, in a playful gesture, the fan dialectically engages with love and the self, treating both as philosophical questions.
