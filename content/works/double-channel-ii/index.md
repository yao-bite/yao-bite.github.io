When we try to understand others, we can only empathize and imagine what others think or feel. So, does this process of putting “ourselves” in others’ shoes make others part of ourselves? When thinking about the self, we engage in the act of othering. Does this mean that the self is, in a way, an other?

We see others through ourselves and ourselves through others.

This work starts with one performer whispering a monologue. When the second performer joins, they reenact the first performer’s act together, creating an impression of mirroring each other’s solo performance. The work delves into different facets of self-awareness, such as what others might represent in our imagination, what we might appear in others’  imagination, and the image of “myself” that we envision.
