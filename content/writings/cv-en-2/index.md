**About**

Lin Pei-Yao was born in 1998 in Taichung, Taiwan. Using herself as an experimental subject, she mainly works with media, video, and installation, capturing the fleeting moments in everyday life where subtle discrepancies arise between sensation and cognition, and exploring the fluid and ever-changing space of perception. Through her work, she strives to create bodily experiences that are ambiguous and interwoven with reality and virtuality, while exploring the possibilities of bodily presence in relation to self-awareness and time perception.
