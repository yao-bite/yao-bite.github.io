When we look, the visual information from both eyes combines to create a single world. Our senses are inherently multi-channel, and our bodies integrate these various channels into a unified perception. Yet, we seldom realize that this "one" is actually composed of multiples. The term "double-channel" originally describes a plural state. Starts from the visual mechanism, this exhibition further embodies its dual characteristics and two-sided nature, by the interaction between bodies and video technology.

“What makes the front of man? His eyes. It is his eyes.” — Laurie Anderson, *Songs and Stories from Moby Dick* (1999)

Through media, a multi-channel body further multiplies its perceptions. Consequently, an individual’s self-awareness also transforms. LIN Pei-Yao explores new types of relationships through bodily perception, between individuals and themselves, as well as between individuals, in an era mediated by technology.
